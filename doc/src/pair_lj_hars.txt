[Description:]

In the H-AdResS scheme, the description of the interactions within a system of particles is given in terms
of a global Hamiltonian function H, which has the following form "(Potestio2013_1)"_#Potestio2013_1, "(Potestio2013_2)"_#Potestio2013_2, "(Heidari2016)"_#Heidari2016:

:c,image(Eqs/HADRESS_System_Hamiltonian.jpg)

The term K is the atomistic kinetic energy, and V<sup>int</sup> consists of all the intramolecular bonded interactions (e.g. bond stretching).
The value of the switching function is determined by the sizes L<sub>AT</sub>
L<sub>HY</sub> of the atomistic and hybrid regions, respectively, and of the specific geometry of the atomistic region.

In the Hamiltonian, the non-bonded potential energy contribution of each molecule is given by a weighted sum of two terms
V<sub>&#945;</sub><sup>CG</sup> and V<sub>&#945;</sub><sup>AT</sup>, defined as:

:c,image(Eqs/HADRESS_System_Potentials.jpg)

The {lj/cut/hars/at} styles compute the standard 12/6 Lennard-Jones potential for the atoms located in atomistic (high resolution) and hybrid region.
The general formula is given by

:c,image(Eqs/HADRESS_AT_pair_lj.jpg)

rc is the cutoff.

Style {lj/cut/coul/dsf/hars/at} computes the standard 12/6 Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions for atoms of atomistic (high resolution) and hybrid region.
The Coulombic term is computed via the damped shifted force model introduced by "Fennell et al."_#Fennell, given by:

:c,image(Eqs/HADRESS_AT_pair_coul_dsf.jpg)

where {alpha} is the damping parameter and erfc() is the complementary
error-function. This potential is essentially a short-range,
spherically-truncated, charge-neutralized, shifted, pairwise {1/r}
summation.

The {lj/cut/hars/cg} styles compute the standard 12/6 Lennard-Jones potential for the atoms located in the low resolution (coarse-grained) and hybrid region.
The general formula is given by

:c,image(Eqs/HADRESS_CG_pair_lj.jpg)

rc is the cutoff.
As mentioned above, the interactions in the coarse-grained region are computed based on the center of mass of the particles.

Important Note: For dual resolution simulations, it is required to use hybrid/overlay to include
both resolution pair-styles.

For all of dual resolution pair styles, the following coefficients must
be defined for each pair of atoms types via the
"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples below

epsilon (energy units) :l
sigma (distance units) :l
cutoff (distance units) :l

For examples:

  pair_coeff      * * lj/cut/hars/cg 1.0 2.2
  pair_coeff      1 1 lj/cut/coul/dsf/hars/at 0.15535 3.166
  pair_coeff      * 2 lj/cut/coul/dsf/hars/at 0.0000 0.0000 :pre

Note that sigma is defined in the LJ formula as the zero-crossing
distance for the potential, not as the energy minimum at 2^(1/6)
sigma.

All potentials have to be shifted at the cutoff through the command

  pair_modify     shift yes :pre


:line


[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

All of the {lj/cut} pair styles support the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option for the energy of the
Lennard-Jones portion of the pair interaction.

All of the {lj/cut} pair styles write their information to "binary
restart files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do
not need to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

The pair styles do not support the use of the rRESPA hierarchy.

Each pair styles creates a file named as "Mean_Comp_Energy_XX.txt", where the file name's suffix "XX", is replaced by "AT" and "CG" for atomistic and coarse-grained pairwise interactions respectively.
In these files the averaged compensation energy as function of the resolution (&#955;) is printed. Each file is created at {T<sub>p</sub><sup>Start</sup>} and is updated every {dT<sub>p</sub>}.
The updating process of the files is finished at time step {T<sub>p</sub><sup>End</sup>}.
For those equilibrated simulations starting at time step larger than {T<sub>p</sub><sup>End</sup>}, the file "Mean_Comp_Energy_XX.txt" is loaded in each pair styles. For more information,
see "fix_lambdah_calc"_fix_lambdah_calc.html.

[Restrictions:]

In HAdResS, it is required to include both high resolution (atomistic)
and low resolution (coarse-grained) force fields together through

  pair_style      hybrid/overlay :pre
An example of such setup is given above.

To employ the H-AdResS scheme, the full/hars atom style as well as "(fix_lambdah_calc)"_fix_lambdah_calc.html have to be used:

  atom_style      full/hars :pre

  fix             ID group-ID lambdah/calc ... :pre
