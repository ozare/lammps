compute bop/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID bop/atom cutoff quality :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
bop/atom = style name of this compute command
cutoff = distance within which to count coordination neighbors (distance units)
q = spherical harmonics grid quality (0-5)

[Examples:]

compute 1 all bop/atom 5.0 :pre
compute 1 all bop/atom 4.5 3 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the bond order parameters for
each atom in the group.

The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (e.g. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently or to have multiple compute/dump commands, each with a
{bop/atom} style.

An efficient technique for calculating the bond-orientational order
parameters is taken from "bopcalc"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/bench.html,
which is an implementation of the algorithm described in the 2016
"paper"_#Winczewski Winczewski et al.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom array with 4 columns.
These values can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See "Section_howto
15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The 4 columns are the four bond order parameter invariants:
Q4, Q6, W4 and W6. The invariants and their typical values
for different lattices are described in the 1983 "paper"_#Paper
by Steinhardt, et al.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-BOP package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Default:] none
